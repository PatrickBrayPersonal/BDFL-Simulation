    "## What Does This Mean?\n",
    "The simulation is based on projected player performance from fantasypros.com. These projections don't take into account injuries, breakout players, halftime-retirements, and all the unpredicable things that happen during a football season. The simulation only introduces randomness at the game-level which normalizes over 13 games. What this means is the simulation is a lot more confident than it should be and will predict a week 13 game with the same confidence as a week 1 game. For the playoff percentages, I would recommend imagining each team a little closer to 50% than where they are at now, and shrink that error each week we get closer to the playoffs.\n",

    "## What Next?\n",
    "* Weekly Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "    This methodology is a lot more effective once it can recieve weekly player projections. It could even help you set your lineup using more than just mean points. I'll let the groupme know when this is available. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Season-Level Player Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some players have a chance at a breakout year. We'll incorporate a distribution on top of the fantasy pros projections to introduce the uncertainty you would expect from fantasy football at the season-level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Player-Specific Variance / Non-Normal Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "    Right now the simulation treats the distribution of points from a player on a given week as normal (which is wrong), with a variance determined by the roster position. However, Will Fuller has a much larger variation in points than Cooper Kupp and we should capture that."
